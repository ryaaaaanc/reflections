How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Bugs usually are created by changes in a document
By comparing two versions of a file we can see which parts are changed
And bugs are most likely created in these changes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
If you made some errors you can revert to the previous version very easily

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pros: I control the time to save
Cons: I forgot to save

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
So that the changes can be more consistent

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
use git log to find the id of different versions
and then use git diff to find the difference

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I can always return to the previous version!
